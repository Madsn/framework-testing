# Battle of the JVM frameworks

I've singled out a few web development stacks that I want to test out.

My primary requirement for now is that it should run on the JVM, but I may decide later on to expand and include frameworks like RoR, Django, Node.js, ASP.NET, Clojure/Luminus and possibly others.

## The application

For use in Scrum on my team for various occasions when it is necessary to cycle through team members, or choose a single member at random.

### Features:

- Authentication.
- Setup of team (CRUD members).
- Ability to cycle through team members (for our daily Battleships game vs the other team). It should be possible to postpone the "turn" of the team member in case that person is not available.
- Ability to draw a name at random from the team.
